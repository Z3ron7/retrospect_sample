      description:
        "The Ruins Mansion is the remains of an ancestral home built in 1920 by a wealthy sugar baron named Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson. Don Mariano constructed the mansion as a testament of his love for his Portuguese wife, Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga, after she passed away in 1911. Maria, who was pregnant with their eleventh child at the time, lost her and their baby’s lives after figuring in an accident. \nDon Mariano built the structure in a 440-hectare sugar plantation situated in the border of present-day Talisay and Bacolod. Its architecture was described as Italianate due to deriving inspiration from Italian Architecture. However, it was later set aflame in 1942 by Filipino guerilla fighters employed by the United States Armed Forces during the Second World War.",

      title: "Hinagdanan Cave",
      description: "The Hinagdanan Cave, meaning “Laddered” in Cebuano, is one of the many wondrous caves in the island province of Bohol. The cave was accidentally discovered by a farmer; while clearing his land he found 2 holes, curious, he dropped a stone and heard a splash. He built a ladder “hagdan” and was able to access the cave and find its hidden beauty, thus the origin of the name Hinagdanan.\nAside from its awe-inspiring natural beauty, Hinagdanan also holds a bit of history from the Second World War. The cave was once used as a hideout by the locals to escape from the Japanese Imperial army, but unfortunately they were still found.\nThe cave’s entrance, which leads to a cavern that is less than a hundred meters long, can only be entered one at a time. The slimy and smooth friction on the walkway is caused by the cave’s natural water droplets.",

      description: "The Magellan Cross history traces its roots back to 1521 when the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan set his foot in Cebu. He befriended the locals and the native chief Rajah Humabon. Rajah Humabon, his wife and hundreds of his native warriors were baptized as they agreed to accept Christianity. On April 21, 1521, Magellan planted a cross to signify this important event about the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith in Cebu.",
